He served as [[Prime Minister of Vietnam]] from 1945 to 1955, and as [[President of Vietnam]] from 1945 until his death in 1969. Ideologically a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]], he was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Chairman and First Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Vietnam]].{{Efn|Predecessor of the current [[Communist Party of Vietnam]]}}\n\n{{lang|vi|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh|italic=no}} was born in [[Ngh\u1ec7 An province]] in the [[French protectorate of Annam]]. From 1911, he left [[French Indochina]] to continue his revolutionary activities. He was also one of the founding members of the [[French Communist Party]]. In 1930, he founded the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] and in 1941, he returned to Vietnam and founded the {{lang|vi|[[Viet Minh|Vi\u1ec7t Minh]]|italic=no}} independence movement, an [[Umbrella organization|umbrella group]]. Then, {{lang|vi|H\u1ed3|italic=no}} led the [[August Revolution]] against the Japanese in August 1945, which resulted in the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|independence]] of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. After the French returned to power the following month, H\u1ed3's government retreated to the [[Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc]] region and began [[guerrilla warfare]]. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh defeated the [[French Union]] in 1954 at the [[Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7|Battle of {{lang|vi|\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7|italic=no|nocat=y}}]], ending the [[First Indochina War]], and resulting in the [[1954 Geneva Conference|division of Vietnam]], with the Vi\u1ec7t Minh in control of North Vietnam, and anti-communists in control of [[South Vietnam]]. He was a key figure in the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] and the {{lang|vi|[[Viet Cong|Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]]|italic=no}} during the [[Vietnam War]], which lasted from 1955 to 1975. H\u1ed3 officially stepped down from power in 1965 due to health problems and died in 1969. North Vietnam was ultimately [[Fall of Saigon|victorious]] against South Vietnam and its [[United States in the Vietnam War|allies]]. [[Vietnam]] was officially [[Reunification Day|unified]] in 1976. Saigon, the former capital of South Vietnam, was renamed [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in his honor.\n\nThe details of {{lang|vi|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh|italic=no}}'s life before he came to power in Vietnam are uncertain. He is known to have used between 50<ref name=\"Duiker\">Duiker, William J. ''Ho Chi Minh: A Life''. New York: Hyperion, 2000. <!-- ISBN ?? --></ref>{{rp|582}} and 200 pseudonyms.{{sfn|Duncanson|1957|p=85}} Information on his birth and early life is ambiguous and subject to academic debate. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, dates, places, and other hard facts while unofficial biographies vary even more widely.{{sfn|Pike|1976}}\n\nAside from being a politician, H\u1ed3 was a writer, poet, and journalist. He wrote several books, articles, and poems in Chinese, Vietnamese, and French.\n\n==Early life==\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was born as Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Cung<ref name=\"BBC2005\"/>{{efn|name=\"HL1\"}}<ref name=\"HL2\"/> in 1890 in the village of L\u00e0ng Ch\u00f9a or [[Ho\u00e0ng Tr\u00f9]] in [[Kim Li\u00ean, Ngh\u1ec7 An|Kim Li\u00ean]] commune, Ngh\u1ec7 An province, in [[Central Vietnam]] which was then a [[Annam (French protectorate)|French protectorate]]. Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years:{{sfn|Tr\u1ea7n D\u00e2n Ti\u00ean|1994|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2021}} 1891,<ref>Yen Son. \"Nguyen Ai Quoc, the Brilliant Champion of the Revolution.\" Thuong Tin Hanoi. 30 August 1945.</ref> 1892,{{efn|In his application to the French Colonial School \u2013 \"Nguyen Tat Thanh, born 1892 at Vinh, son of Mr. Nguyen Sinh Huy (sub doctor in literature)\"}} 1894{{efn|He told Paris Police (Surete) he was born 15 January 1894.}} and 1895.<ref>Ton That Thien 18, 1890 is the most likely year of his birth. There is troubling conflicting evidence, however. When he was arrested in Hong Kong in 1931, he attested in court documents that he was 36. The passport he used to enter Russia in 1921 also gave the year 1895 as his birth date. His application to the Colonial School in Paris gave his birth year as 1892</ref> He lived in his father [[Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh S\u1eafc]]'s village of L\u00e0ng Sen in Kim Li\u00ean until 1895 when his father sent him to [[Hu\u1ebf]] for study. He had three siblings: his sister B\u1ea1ch Li\u00ean (Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh), a clerk in the [[French Army]]; his brother [[Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Khi\u00eam]] (Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1t), a [[geomancy|geomancer]] and [[Traditional Chinese herbs|traditional herbalist]]; and another brother (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Nhu\u1eadn), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (H\u1ed3) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do. He quickly mastered [[Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]], a prerequisite for any serious study of [[Confucianism]] while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing.<ref name=\"Duiker\"/>{{rp|21}} In addition to his studies, he was fond of adventure and loved to fly [[kite]]s and go fishing.<ref name=\"Duiker\"/>{{rp|21}} Following Confucian tradition, his father gave him a new name at the age of 10: ''Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t Th\u00e0nh.''\n\nHis father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe ([[Qui Nh\u01a1n]]). He was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received 102 strokes of the [[Caning|cane]] as punishment for an infraction.<ref name=\"Duiker\" />{{rp|21}} His father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy, but he refused because it meant serving the French.{{sfn|Hunt|2016|p=125}} This exposed Th\u00e0nh (H\u1ed3) to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province. Nevertheless, he received a French education, attending ''[[Qu\u1ed1c H\u1ecdc \u2013 Hu\u1ebf High School for the Gifted|Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc]]'' (''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' or secondary education) in Hu\u1ebf in Central Vietnam. His disciples, [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]] and [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]], also attended the school, as did [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]], the future President of South Vietnam and political rival.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nguoi-viet.com/viet-nam/hang-tram-nguoi-cong-khai-lam-le-gio-tt-ngo-dinh-diem/|title=Ngo Dinh Diem and ho Chi Minh|date=3 November 2018|publisher=nguoiviet.com}}</ref>\n\nHis early life is uncertain but there are some documents indicating activities regarding an early revolutionary spirit during French-occupied Vietnam, but conflicting sources remain. Previously, it was believed that Th\u00e0nh (H\u1ed3) was involved in an anti-slavery (anti-''[[corv\u00e9e]]'') demonstration of poor peasants in Hu\u1ebf in May 1908, which endangered his student status at ''Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc''. However, a document from the [[Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer|Centre des archives d'Outre-mer]] in France shows that he was admitted to ''Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc'' on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-''corv\u00e9e'' demonstration (9\u201313 April 1908).{{efn|name=\"HL1\"}}\n\nLater in life, he claimed the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School in 1911 undermines this version of events, in which he stated that he left school to go abroad. Because his father had been dismissed, he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward, taking a position at D\u1ee5c Thanh school in [[Phan Thi\u1ebft]] for about six months, then traveled to [[Saigon]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Overseas sojourn==\n===In France===\n[[File: Ho Chi Minh Plaque (6887120535).jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative plaque in Haymarket in London]]\nIn Saigon, he applied to work as a kitchen helper on a French merchant steamer, the ''Amiral de Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville'', using the alias V\u0103n Ba. The ship departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in [[Marseille]], [[French Third Republic|France]] on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for [[Le Havre]] and [[Dunkirk]], returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the ''French Colonial Administrative School'', but his application was rejected. He instead decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visiting many countries from 1911 to 1917.{{sfn|Tucker|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2021}}\n\n===In the United States===\nWhile working as the cook's helper on a ship in 1912, Th\u00e0nh (H\u1ed3) traveled to the United States. From 1912 to 1913, he may have lived in New York City ([[Harlem]]) and [[Boston]], where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the [[Omni Parker House|Parker House Hotel]].
